[^1]:"$PWD" is a variable which holds the path of the folder where the terminal you are using is currently doing stuff from, or inside of  
‚Äî  
See what it is with:  
  echo "$PWD"  
‚Äî  
  If "$PWD" is:                    /home/Username/  
  Then the command:                mkdir lolfolder  
  ...will (attempt to) create:     /home/Username/lolfolder/</pre>  


## Shorten "if ; then ; elif ; else ; fi "-blocks
*The following examples check whether or not "$PWD" [^1] is a folder using:* ```[ -d /path/to/folder ]```
<br> *and then outputs a text ‚Äî chosen by you ‚Äî depending on whether or not it is, or isn't a folder<br> (hopefully it is)*


#### You can write these if-statements:

```
if [ -d "$PWD" ];then;echo "Yeah it is";else;echo "Hmmm... It should be";fi
```

```
if [ -d "$PWD" ]
then
   echo "Yeah it is"
else
   echo "Hmmm... It should be"
fi
```
#  
<b> Like this: </b>
   

```
[ -d "$PWD" ] && echo "ofc" || echo "lol wut"

```  
<sup> <b> *or like this:* </b> </sup>

```
[ -d "$PWD" ] && 
( echo "ofc" ) || 
( echo "lol wut" )
```

<b> <sup> *even like this* </b> </sup> 

   
```
[ -d "$PWD" ] &&
( 
  echo -e "\nofc"
  echo -e "it's only logical"
  echo -e "...get it? like spock"
  sleep .7 && echo -en "\n:"   
  sleep .5 && echo -en "'"
  sleep .4 && echo -e "D"    
   
) || (  

  echo "lol wut"

)
```
<sup> <b>note:</b> you can also use curlybrackets for the given examples, and they will return the desired values, but you shouldn't. see [refrences](https://github.com/Skrimpton/Guides-and-Cheatsheets/blob/main/LINUX%20TERMINAL%20TIPS'N'TRICKS%20-%20WILL%20THEY%20WORK%20ON%20YOURS%3F%20(...%20for%20real:%20verify%20safety%20first,%20then%20try%20them%20-%20they%20should%20be%20safe%20little%20things,%20but%20better%20certain%20than%20sorry%20amirite%3F%20-%20...).md#refrence-list-for-here-be-dragons-)

  
#### elif 
 
<sup> *Here we first check if PWD is a folder using an if-statement <br>
and then echoing something if the if-test returns true*</sup>

<sup>*The example exits in the elif-part, see the [linked](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53900466) stackoverflow response for more details* </sup>


```
( [ ! -d "$PWD" ] && echo -e "Not a folder..?" ) || ( [ -d "$PWD" ] && echo -e "Yeah it should be a folder" ) || echo -e ":O"   
```

  > *Also note that ( and [ are technically commands, so whitespace is required around them.*

 <sup>right way: <code>( [ -d /folder ] )</code></sup>

<sup>wrong way: <code>([-d /folder])</code></sup>

set

## Newline(s)/empty line(s) in Terminal

#### You can add new (empty) lines in your command prompt
  *So you can write that all-too-long-one-liner similiar to how you would in a script ‚Äî with visible newlines! ‚Äî like God intended*
  - powershell (windows 10): shift + enter
  - zsh: alt + enter / esc + enter
  - bash: ctrl + j *followed by* crtl + v
  
  [St√©phane Chazelas](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/80820)
  > *Alternatively, instead of typing *Enter*, you can type Ctrl-V* (then) *Ctrl-J...*
  <br>*... To get the same behavior in bash, you can add to your ~/.inputrc:* <sup>
  <br>[disclaimer: only make changes like  this if you're sure there won't be dire sideffects]</sup>

## Kill all Jobs (they must die)
  *Functional (but bad and ugly) modified solution based on
  <br>good solution found in comment by user <b>jw013</b> to [this stackexchange question](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/43527)*
![newline-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64572787/149652146-07720bae-bf23-4679-9f07-2d544403ce54.png) 

  
*- Kill all jobs*

```
alias kill-all-jobs='thejobs=$(jobs | wc -l);[ "$thejobs" != 0 ] && while [ "$thejobs" != 0 ];do for i in "$thejobs"; do [ "$thejobs" != 0 ] && kill %$i; done; thejobs=$(jobs | wc -l); done || echo "No jobs"'
```


*- Kill all <b>suspended</b> jobs*

```
alias kill-all-suspended='thejobs=$(jobs -ps | wc -l);[ "$thejobs" != 0 ] && while [ "$thejobs" != 0 ];do for i in "$thejobs"; do [ "$thejobs" != 0 ] && kill %$i; done; thejobs=$(jobs -ps | wc -l); done || echo "No suspended jobs"'
```

*- Readable version - for use in a script*
```
#!/bin/bash
  
####### SWITCHING WHICH OF THESE TWO LINES ARE COMMENTED OUT CHANGES IT FROM SUSPENDED JOBS TO ALL BACKGROUND JOBS
####### this is determined by the -ps option of the "jobs"-command 

#thejobs=$(jobs | wc -l) 
thejobs=$(jobs -ps | wc -l)
  
###################################################################  

[ "$thejobs" != 0 ] && while [ "$thejobs" != 0 ]
  do 
    for i in "$thejobs" 
      do 
        [ "$thejobs" != 0 ] && kill %$i
      done
    thejobs=$(jobs -ps | wc -l)
  done || echo "Nothing to kill"
```
